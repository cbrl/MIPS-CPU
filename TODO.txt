? make PC a special register in the register file

? bitwise logical statements for control unit port assignments (like in sparc_ifu_dec.v)
  > more in line with actual hardware design
  > less code duplication
  > harder to read/debug
  
> separate memory and control unit from datapath

> implement instructions
  > BLTZ, BGEZ, BLTZAL, BGEZAL

> multiplication/division instructions (and HI/LO registers)

> exception when pc_next is not word aligned

> interfaces?
